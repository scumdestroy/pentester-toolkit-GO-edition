#Pentester Toolkit - GO Edition
#Good list of the trillest pentesting weapons written in Go, and a skid-level script to get 'em all brainlessly.
#Also lots of these have dependencies or binary releases that work a bit better so check the readmes instead of your berzerk download mania, take it easy, bruh
# to download all of them you can just 
#: cat README.md | grep github | awk -F "https://" '{print $2}' | tee goodboy.txt 
#: for goodboy in $(cat goodboy.txt); do go get $goodboy ; done
# some people need to add GOMODULE111=ON to the "go get $goodboy GOMODULE111=ON" part to download anything in Go
#Thanks for reading!
